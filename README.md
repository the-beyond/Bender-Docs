# Galactus Documentation
This is intended as a publicly available documentation for WMD's Bender Discord Bot. 
The bot has been developed by feather4102 in Python using the Nextcord module which is a fork of the original discord.py module.  

There are lots of easter eggs to find!

* The Prefixes for Bender bot are ```$```, ```?``` and ```? ```. For my examples I will always use \$, but it is interchangable with the others if you wish, and there are multiple so people can decide what they like. A large amount of commands however are slash commands only. 

### Key Notes
* Anything listed in \<> is a required argument for the commands and the command will not work without it, __DO NOT INCLUDE THE \<> IN THE COMMAND__.
* Anything listed in \[] is an optional argument for the commands and allows the command to use what you add, __DO NOT INCLUDE THE \[] IN THE COMMAND__.
* For slash commands I have included what each item in <> or [] represents by writing it in as ```<title: purpose>``` with the purpose being everything after the colon. 


## Utility Commands 
* ```$ping``` - Get the bot's ping!
* ```/ping``` - Get the bot's ping!
* ```/documentation``` - Get the link for the bot's documentation!
* ```/factionlink``` - Get the faction link!

## Request Commands
* ```$bank <amount>``` - Request an amount of money from the bankers!
* ```/bank <amount: amount of money needed, must be a number!>``` - Slash command to request money from the bankers!

## Fun Commands
* ```$rigged``` - Calls out Fatties for rigging things!
* ```$conversions``` - Get some handy conversions!

## Fun Slash Commands
* ```/pumped <target: who is getting their mother pumped> [pumper: who is doing the pumping, if left blank defaults to the command user]``` - Someone is gonna pump someone else's mom. 
* ```/askbender <question: Needs to be a Yes or No question>``` - Ask Bender a question! (Kinda like a magic 8 ball)
